TODO List
=========

* commit and validate URIs have kind of an RPC smell about them, can they be 
  expressed more RESTfully? 
* recommend rel values for links to bags, and component resources that may
  be present: copies, notes, manifest, contents, metadata, etc?
* Consider JSON-C instead of Atom to avoid any XML requirements
* Full use cases for:
    * Mirroring content
    * Using PuSH to avoid polling
* Add an example static endpoint
* Convert to proper standards-ese
* Simple Python prototype which serves a directory of bags
* Proposal for extending the prototype to front S3/Swift for semi-serious
  testing
